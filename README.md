# Ancient Mersin VR — UX & HCI Case Study

## Overview

This repository presents a UX and Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) case study conducted around the *Ancient Mersin VR* immersive cultural heritage experience showcased during the EMITT tourism exhibition.

The project investigates how visitors interact with immersive technologies in a public, high-traffic environment and how multi-touchpoint design (physical booth, VR headset, and QR-based mobile interaction) can support engagement, accessibility, and long-term recall.

This case study documents the design context, research approach, interaction flow, and experiential outcomes of the installation.

## Context

Mersin has significant historical and cultural heritage that is often underrepresented in traditional exhibition formats. The VR installation was developed to transform static historical information into an engaging, first-person experiential narrative.

The exhibition setting created a real-world environment in which visitors with varying levels of technological familiarity could interact with the experience.

## My Contribution

Although I was not responsible for developing the VR application itself, I contributed to the overall experience design and evaluation process by:

- Observing visitor behavior in a live exhibition environment  
- Supporting onboarding and interaction flow  
- Mapping user journeys and interaction touchpoints  
- Identifying usability barriers and engagement patterns  
- Collecting qualitative feedback to inform future iterations  

This work reflects a field-based UX research and experience design perspective.

## Research Approach

The study followed a lightweight, in-the-wild research methodology suitable for a public exhibition context.

Methods included:

- Structured observation of visitor interaction patterns  
- Short intercept feedback conversations  
- Documentation of behavioral indicators such as hesitation, engagement, and session duration  
- Mapping the experience across physical, immersive, and mobile touchpoints  

As detailed analytics were not available, insights are based on observational findings and illustrative estimations intended to guide future improvements.

## Experience Scope

The overall experience combined multiple interaction layers:

- Exhibition booth and curved display (attraction phase)  
- Guided VR immersion into reconstructed ancient environments  
- Post-experience QR-based interaction enabling visitors to generate a personalized digital memory  

This multi-channel structure extended the experience beyond the headset into a persistent digital engagement.

## Outcomes & Insights

Key observations suggested that:

- Clear onboarding significantly reduced hesitation among first-time VR users  
- Story-driven environments generated stronger emotional engagement  
- Short, structured sessions improved completion rates in a crowded setting  
- Post-experience interaction increased memorability and sharing behavior  

These findings informed recommendations for improving clarity, comfort, and continuity across touchpoints.
